### 🔧 About Me

I'm a results-driven SRE Engineering Lead with nearly two decades of experience building scalable, secure, and reliable systems. From high-volume ingestion platforms to cloud-native microservices, I specialize in driving operational excellence and modernizing infrastructure with automation-first principles.

💡 My expertise lies at the intersection of:
- 🌐 Cloud Architecture (AWS, Hybrid, On-Prem)
- ☸️ Kubernetes & Container Orchestration (EKS, ECS, OpenShift)
- 🔁 GitOps & CI/CD (Helm, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Terraform)
- 📊 Observability (Datadog, ELK, Dashboards, SLO/SLIs)
- 🧠 MLOps Enablement (Kubeflow, Model Pipelines, GPU workloads)
- 🔐 Security, Resiliency & Cost Optimization
